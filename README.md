 Gas Leakage monitoring & Alerting system for Industries
 
 ## ðŸ“’ PROJECT DESCRIPTION
 
 The main objective of the project is early detection of gas leakage. Gas leakage leads to various accidents resulting in both material loss and human injuries. The risk of explosions, firing, suffocation are based on their physical properties such toxicity, flammability, etc. The number of deaths due to gas explosions has been increasing day by day. The reasons for such explosions are worn-out regulators, old valves and lack of awareness in handling gases. So to preventing such type of accidents we are going to design a circuits using sensors. With the detection of a gas leak by the sensor, an sound alarm, alert message will be send.
